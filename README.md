# Hi, I'm Swaraj Gupta ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about **data science**, **machine learning**, **data engineering**, and **open-source projects**. I specialize in developing **data-driven solutions** and building **automated systems** using cutting-edge technologies.

## ðŸš€ Experience

### Associate Engineer at Smart Analytica  
*Client: Suryoday Bank*  
*Technologies: PySpark, Machine Learning, Shell Script, Sqoop, Data Warehousing, Oozie, SQL*

- Designed and implemented scalable ETL pipelines using Sqoop, PySpark, Hive, and Shell, ensuring reliable and efficient
data flow from source systems to the data warehouse.
- Optimized Sqoop ingestion performance by selecting the ideal split-by column and tuning the number of mappers,
reducing ingestion time by 25%.
- Developed a pre-approved loan eligibility machine learning model using business-specific datamarts, improving targeting
accuracy by 15% and reducing credit risk through better customer profiling.
- Created and maintained 5+ business-critical datamarts, enabling seamless report generation and reducing data retrieval
time by 30%.
- Automated and orchestrated ETL workflows using Apache Oozie, cutting manual effort and improving job reliability and
success rate.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection on customer transaction data using Python (Pandas,
Seaborn, Scikit-learn) to identify key behavioral patterns, laying groundwork for future classification models.
- Automated schema conversion from Greenplum to Hive using custom Linux shell scripting, accelerating migration efforts
and reducing manual work.

## ðŸš€ Projects:
1. [**Implementation and Optimization of the Llama 2 Chat Model with Quantized LoRA**](https://github.com/ssjswaraj/LLM-and-NLP/tree/main/Llama%202%20(QLoRA)%20with%20Guanaco%20Database%20Using%20Transformer%20Fine%20Tune#implementation-and-optimization-of-the-llama-2-chat-model-with-quantized-lora)

   *Tools & Libraries: Python, Transformers, PEFT, Bitsandbytes, Accelerate, TRL, Hugging Face Datasets*
   - Implemented and fine-tuned the Llama 2 Chat Model using Quantized LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) to reduce memory and computational requirements for resource-constrained environments.
   - Loaded and tokenized conversational datasets using Hugging Face libraries, and applied model quantization along with LoRA-based fine-tuning to significantly reduce trainable parameters and memory footprint.
   - Trained the model using the Trainer class with optimized hyperparameters, achieving low-latency response generation and 30â€“50% reduction in resource usage without sacrificing output qualityâ€”making the model ideal for edge deployments.
  
3. [**Travel Insurance Prediction**](https://github.com/ssjswaraj/Deploy_Travel_Insurance_ML)
   *Tools: Machine Learning, Python, Scikit-learn, Streamlit, API Integration*
  - Built and optimized a Random Forest model using real-time API data and preprocessing techniques, achieving 84% accuracy in predicting customer travel insurance purchases.
  - Performed hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV to enhance model performance and compared multiple algorithms for best results.
  - Developed and deployed an interactive Streamlit web app on the community cloud, enabling users to get instant purchase likelihood predictions.
