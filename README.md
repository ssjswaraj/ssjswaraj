# Hi, I'm Swaraj Gupta ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub profile! I'm passionate about **data science**, **machine learning**, **data engineering**, and **open-source projects**. I specialize in developing **data-driven solutions** and building **automated systems** using cutting-edge technologies.

## ðŸš€ Experience

### Associate Engineer at Smart Analytica  
*Client: Suryoday Bank*  
*Technologies: PySpark, Machine Learning, Shell Script, Sqoop, Data Warehousing, Oozie, SQL*

- Designed and implemented scalable ETL pipelines using Sqoop, PySpark, Hive, and Shell, ensuring reliable and efficient
data flow from source systems to the data warehouse.
- Optimized Sqoop ingestion performance by selecting the ideal split-by column and tuning the number of mappers,
reducing ingestion time by 25%.
- Developed a pre-approved loan eligibility machine learning model using business-specific datamarts, improving targeting
accuracy by 15% and reducing credit risk through better customer profiling.
- Created and maintained 5+ business-critical datamarts, enabling seamless report generation and reducing data retrieval
time by 30%.
- Automated and orchestrated ETL workflows using Apache Oozie, cutting manual effort and improving job reliability and
success rate.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) and feature selection on customer transaction data using Python (Pandas,
Seaborn, Scikit-learn) to identify key behavioral patterns, laying groundwork for future classification models.
- Automated schema conversion from Greenplum to Hive using custom Linux shell scripting, accelerating migration efforts
and reducing manual work.

## ðŸš€ Projects:
- [**Dog vs Cat Image Classification**](https://github.com/ssjswaraj/Deep-Learning-and-CV/tree/main/Dogs%20Vs%20Cats%20Classification)  
  This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify images of dogs and cats, using Python and TensorFlow's Keras API. Utilizing a comprehensive dataset of labeled dog and cat images, the project's primary goal is to accurately differentiate between the two classes.The model achieved 91% accuracy, showcasing CNNâ€™s power in image classification. It offers a strong foundation for advancing applications in computer vision.
  
- [**Travel Insurance Prediction**](https://github.com/ssjswaraj/Deploy_Travel_Insurance_ML)  
 I developed a predictive model to assess the likelihood of customers purchasing travel insurance using data sourced from an API. After preprocessing the data, I tested various machine learning algorithms and selected Random Forest, achieving 84% accuracy. I then deployed the model as an interactive web application on Streamlit, allowing users to get predictions instantly. This project showcased my skills in data preprocessing, model selection, and deploying machine learning solutions in a production environment.

## ðŸŒ± Currently Learning:
- **Deep Dive into Advanced Machine Learning & Deep Learning**  
  Exploring complex models and techniques to push the boundaries of AI applications.
- **Mastering Transformer Architecture & Natural Language Processing (NLP)**  
  Focusing on state-of-the-art techniques for handling and understanding language in machines.
